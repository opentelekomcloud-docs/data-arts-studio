Managing Notifications
======================

You can configure job notification tasks to notify you of job success or failures.

Configuring a Notification
--------------------------

Before configuring a notification for a job:

-  Message notification has been enabled and a topic has been configured.
-  A job not in **Not Activated** status has been submitted.

#. On the DataArts Studio console, locate a workspace and click **DataArts Factory**.

#. In the navigation pane on the DataArts Factory page, choose **Monitoring** > **Manage Notification**.

#. On the **Notification Management** tab page, click **Configure Notification**. In the displayed dialog box, configure parameters. :ref:`Table 1 <dataartsstudio_01_0514__en-us_topic_0114591806_table63861718143217>` describes the parameters.
