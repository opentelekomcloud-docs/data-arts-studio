Importing a Script
------------------

This function is available only if the OBS service is available. If OBS is unavailable, scripts can be imported from the local PC.

You can import one or more script files in the script directory. After a job is imported, the content in the development state is overwritten and a new version is automatically submitted.

#. Click |image3| and choose **Import Script** in the script directory, select a script file that has been uploaded to OBS, and set **Duplicate Name Policy**.

   .. note::

      If you select **Overwrite** for **Duplicate Name Policy** but the hard lock policy is used and the script is locked by another user, the overwriting will fail. For details about soft and hard lock policies, see :ref:`Configuring the Hard and Soft Lock Policy <dataartsstudio_01_04501__section140018355442>`.
