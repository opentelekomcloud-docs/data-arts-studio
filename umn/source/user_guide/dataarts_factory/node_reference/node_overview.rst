Node Overview
=============

A node defines the operations performed on data. DataArts Factory provides nodes used for data integration, computing and analysis, database operations, and resource management. You can choose your desired nodes

-  Node parameters can be presented using Expression Language (EL). For details about how to use EL, see :ref:`Expression Overview <dataartsstudio_01_0494>`.

-  Nodes cannot be connected in serial or parallel mode.

   Serial connection: Nodes are run one by one. Specifically, node B runs only after node A is finished running.

   Parallel connection: Nodes are run at the same time.
