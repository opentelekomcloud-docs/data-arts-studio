Creating a Data Connection
==========================

After a data connection is created, you can perform data operations on DataArts Factory, for example, managing databases, namespaces, database schema, and tables.

With one data connection, you can run multiple jobs and develop multiple scripts. If the connection information saved in the data connection changes, you only need to modify the corresponding information in Connection Management.


Creating a Data Connection
--------------------------

The data connection of DataArts Factory is created based on the data connection of Management Center. For details about how to create a data connection, see :ref:`Creating Data Connections <dataartsstudio_01_0009>`.

Viewing Connection References
-----------------------------

To view the references of a connection, perform the following steps:

#. Log in to the DataArts Studio console. Locate an instance and click **Access**. On the displayed page, locate a workspace and click **DataArts Factory**.
