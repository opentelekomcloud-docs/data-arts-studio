Creating a CDM Cluster
======================

CDM provides independent clusters for secure and reliable data migration. Clusters are isolated from each other and cannot access each other.

CDM clusters can be used in the following scenarios:

-  They can be used to create and run data migration jobs.
-  They can function as agents for connecting Management Center to a data lake.

If you want to use DataArts Migration but the DataArts Studio instance has no CDM cluster, create one by following the instructions in section "(Optional) Creating an Incremental Package" in "Preparations" in the *DataArts Studio User Guide*.
