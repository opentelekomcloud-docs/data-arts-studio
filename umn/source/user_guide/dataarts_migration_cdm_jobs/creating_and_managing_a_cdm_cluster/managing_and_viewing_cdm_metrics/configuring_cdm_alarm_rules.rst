Configuring CDM Alarm Rules
===========================

Scenario
--------

Set the alarm rules to customize the monitored objects and notification policies. Then, learn CDM running status in a timely manner.

A CDM alarm rule includes the alarm rule name, monitored object, metric, threshold, monitoring interval, and whether to send a notification. This section describes how to set CDM alarm rules.

Procedure
---------

#. Access the CDM console, choose **Cluster Management**. Locate a cluster, click **More** in the **Operation** column, and select **View Metric** from the drop-down list.

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Cloud Service Monitoring** > **Cloud Data Migration**. In the right pane, locate a CDM cluster and click **Create Alarm Rule** in the **Operation** column.
