What Is DataArts Studio?
========================

Challenges to Enterprise Digital Transformation
-----------------------------------------------

Enterprises often face challenges in the following aspects when managing data:

-  Governance

   -  Inconsistent data system standards impact data exchange and sharing between different departments.
   -  There are no great search tools to help service personnel locate the data they need when they need it.
   -  If metadata fails to define data in business terms that are familiar to data consumers, the data is difficult to understand.
   -  When there are no good methods to evaluate and control data quality, it makes the data hard to trust.

-  Operations

   -  Data analysts and decision makers require efficient data operations. There is no efficient data operations platform to address the growing and diversified demands for analytics and reporting.
   -  Repeated development of the same data wastes time, slows down development, and results in too many data copies. Inconsistent data standards waste resources and drive up costs.

-  Innovation

   -  Data silos prevent data from being shared and circulated across departments in enterprises. As a result, cross-domain data analysis and data innovation fail to be stimulated.
   -  Currently, most enterprises still utilize their data for analytics and reporting. There is a long way to go before enterprises have widespread, data-driven service innovation.


What Is DataArts Studio?
------------------------

DataArts StudioDataArts Studio is a one-stop data operations platform that drives digital transformation. It allows you to perform many operations, such as integrating and developing data. Incorporating big data storage, computing and analytical engines, it can also construct industry knowledge bases and help your enterprise build an intelligent end-to-end data system. This system can eliminate data silos, unify data standards, accelerate data monetization, and accelerate your enterprise's digital transformation.

:ref:`Figure 1 <dataartsstudio_07_001__fig156921728104018>` shows the architecture.

   **Figure 1** Architecture

As shown in the figure, DataArts Studio is based on the data lake base and provides capabilities such as data integration, development, governance, and openness. DataArts Studio can connect to data lakes and cloud database services, such as Data Lake Insight (DLI), MRS Hive, and GaussDB(DWS). These data lakes and cloud database services are used as the data lake base. DataArts Studio can also connect to traditional enterprise data warehouses, such as Oracle and Greenplum.

DataArts Studio consists of the following functional modules:

-  **Management Center**

   Management Center supports data connection management and connects to the data lake base for activities such as data development.

-  **DataArts Migration**

   DataArts Migration supports data migration between 20+ data sources and integration of data sources into the data lake. It provides wizard-based configuration and management and supports single table, entire database, incremental, and periodic data integration.

-  **DataArts Factory**

   DataArts Factory helps you build a big data processing center, create data models, integrate data, develop scripts, and orchestrate workflows.
