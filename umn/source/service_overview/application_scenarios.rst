Application Scenarios
=====================

Building Cloud-based Data Platforms with Speed
----------------------------------------------

You can use DataArts Studio to migrate offline data to the cloud and integrate the data into big data services. On the DataArts Studio management console, you can use the integrated data to quickly start developing jobs and easily build enterprise data systems.

**Advantages**

-  Quick data integration

   On the GUI, you can migrate offline or real-time data to cloud warehouses in just a few steps.

-  Multiple warehouse services

   You can choose GaussDB (DWS), MRS, or any other warehouses to meet your service needs.

-  Secure, stable, and cost-saving

   Data on the cloud is secure owing to one-stop data service capabilities and stable data warehouse services; you no longer need to build and maintain big data clusters, significantly reducing costs.
