Should I Select the API or Proxy Connection Type When Creating a Data Connection in Management Center?
======================================================================================================

The API connection type is available only for DataArts Factory.

To ensure that a connection is available for other components such as DataArts Architecture, DataArts Quality, DataArts Catalog, and DataArts Service, you are advised to select the proxy connection type.
