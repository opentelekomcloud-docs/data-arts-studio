Does the Event-based Scheduling Type in DataArts Factory Support Offline Kafka?
===============================================================================

Symptom
-------

During the configuration of a job in DataArts Factory, offline Kafka cannot be selected when **Scheduling Type** is set to **Event-based** and **Event Type** is set to **KAFKA**.

Solution
--------

Only MRS Kafka is supported in this case.
