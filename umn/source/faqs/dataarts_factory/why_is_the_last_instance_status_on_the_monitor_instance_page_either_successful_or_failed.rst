Why Is the Last Instance Status On the Monitor Instance Page Either Successful or Failed?
=========================================================================================

Symptom
-------

The **Last Instance Status** on the **Monitor Instance** page is either successful or failed.

Solution
--------

The last instance status indicates a job has been executed, and the status can only be successful or failed. The Monitor Instance page displays all statuses of the job, including canceled and suspended. In addition, job running exceptions and errors are all job failure statuses.
