Why Can't I Select Specified Peripheral Resources When Creating a Data Connection in DataArts Factory?
======================================================================================================

Possible Causes
---------------

The specified peripheral resources may not be in the same region as the instance.

Solution
--------

Ensure that the current DataArts Studio instance and peripheral resources are in the same region and IAM project. If the enterprise project function is enabled for your account, the current instance and peripheral resources must be in the same enterprise project.
