What Should I Do If the Token Is Invalid During the Execution of a Data Development Node?
=========================================================================================

Symptom
-------

During the execution of a data development node, a message is displayed indicating that the token is invalid.

Solution
--------

Check whether the permissions of the current user in IAM are changed, whether the user is removed from the user group, or whether the permission policy of the user group to which the user belongs is changed.

If they are indeed changed, log in to the system again.
