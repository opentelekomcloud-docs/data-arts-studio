Regions
=======

Concepts
--------

We use a region to identify the location of a data center. You can create resources in a specific region.

-  A region is a physical data center. Each region is completely independent, improving fault tolerance and stability. After a resource is created, its region cannot be changed.

Region Selection
----------------

You are advised to select a region close to you or your target users. This reduces network latency and improves access rate.

Changing the Region of an Instance
----------------------------------

-  You cannot change the region of an instance.

Regions and Endpoints
---------------------

An endpoint is the **request address** for calling an API. Endpoints vary depending on services and regions. You can obtain endpoints of the service from `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/endpoint/index.html>`__.
