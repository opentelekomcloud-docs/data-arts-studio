What Should I Do If a User Cannot View Existing Workspaces After I Have Assigned the Required Policy to the User?
=================================================================================================================

Check whether the user has been added to the workspace. If not, perform the following steps to add the user:

Adding a Member and Assigning a Role
------------------------------------

#. Log in to the DataArts Studio console and access the **Workspaces** page.
#. On the **Workspaces** page, locate the target workspace and click **Edit** in the **Operation** column.
#. Click **Add** under **Workspace Members**. In the displayed **Add Member** dialog box, select **Add User** or **Add Group**, select a member account from the drop-down list, and select a role for it.
#. Click **OK**. You can view or modify the members and roles in the member list, or remove members from the workspace.
