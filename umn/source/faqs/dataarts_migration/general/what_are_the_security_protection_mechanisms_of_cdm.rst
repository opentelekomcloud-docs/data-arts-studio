What Are the Security Protection Mechanisms of CDM?
===================================================

CDM is a fully hosted service that provides the following capabilities to protect user data security:

-  Instance isolation: CDM users can use only their own instances. Instances are isolated from each other and cannot access each other.
-  System hardening: System hardening for security has been performed on the operating system of the CDM instance, so attackers cannot access the operating system from the Internet.
-  Key encryption: Keys of various data sources entered when users create links on CDM are stored in CDM databases using high-strength encryption algorithms.
-  No intermediate storage: During data migration, CDM processes only data mapping and conversion without storing any user data or data fragments.
