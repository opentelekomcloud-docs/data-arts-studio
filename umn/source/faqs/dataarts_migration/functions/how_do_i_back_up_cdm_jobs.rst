How Do I Back Up CDM Jobs?
==========================

Yes. If you do not need to use the CDM cluster for a long time, you can stop or delete it to reduce costs.

Before the deletion, you can use the batch export function of CDM to save all job scripts to a local PC. Then, you can create a cluster and import the jobs again when necessary.
