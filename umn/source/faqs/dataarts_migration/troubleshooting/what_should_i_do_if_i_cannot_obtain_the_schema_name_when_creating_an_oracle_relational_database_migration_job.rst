This may be because you have uploaded the latest ORACLE_8 driver (for example, Oracle Database 21c (21.3) driver), which is not supported yet. You are advised to use the ojdbc8.jar driver in Oracle Database 12c. You can download it from https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/jdbc-ucp-122-downloads.html.
