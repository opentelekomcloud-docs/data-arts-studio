Can I Create Jobs in Batches?
=============================

CDM supports batch job creation with the help of the batch import function. You can create jobs in batches as follows:

#. Create a job manually.
#. Export the job and save the job's JSON file to a local PC.
#. Edit the JSON file and replicate more jobs in the JSON file according to the job configuration.
#. Import the JSON file to the CDM cluster to implement batch job creation.
